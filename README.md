# Explanation:
@echo off: Disables the display of commands in the console window to make it look cleaner.
cd "C:\Path\To\Your\Application": Changes the directory to where your application is located. Replace the path with the actual path to your application.
start YourApplication.exe: Runs your application. Replace YourApplication.exe with the actual name of the executable file.
pause: Keeps the command window open after the script finishes running so you can see any output. This is optional and can be removed if not needed.
Save the Script: Save the file with a .bat extension. For example, RunApplication.bat.

Run the Script: Double-click the .bat file you created to execute the script, and it will launch your application.
